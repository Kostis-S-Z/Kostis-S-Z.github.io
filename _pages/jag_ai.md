# Jag.AI: Just Another General AI toolbox

A work _(constantly)_ in progress.

A project to put things (=Machine Learning algorithms) in order.

Models _(to be)_ examined:
  - Artificial Neural Networks
    - MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM
    - RBF, SOM
    - Autoencoders
    - Hopfield, RBM, DBN
    

  -  _(not so much)_ Bayesian Networks / HMM / GP
   
  - SVM, RVM
  - Genetic
  - Others (Random Walk etc)
