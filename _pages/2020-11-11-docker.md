_Personal notes on how to get started with Docker and understand it better. Based on experience from projects and Udemy's [Docker Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/) course._ 


[Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) 

## Install

_**Windows**_: Not natively supported so it has to run on a Virtual Machine that sits behind the IP of your OS, and uses NAT to access the internet. Same for Mac.


#### Linux

Note: Do ***not*** use your built in default packages like `apt install docker.io`

First, make sure to uninstall old versions

Either use docker's automated script or manually install it. I prefer the manual installation since the automated script installs ript installs the Edge (beta) latest release (whereas manually you can choose the Stable version)

```curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh```

_Or_ 

[Official Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) 

1. Check everything is okay with `docker run hello-world`

2. Create user group (so you dont use sudo all the time)

```sudo usermod -aG docker $USER```

3. Install Docker Machine (optional?)

[Official Site](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) 
Or through the github
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases) 

4. Check with `docker-machine version`

5. Install Docker Compose

[Official Site](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 
Or through the github
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) 


## 101 Explanation

**Image** is the binaries & libraries & sources code of what you want to run
**Container** is an actual instance of that image running as a process

Meaning you can run many containers of the same image.

***Containers aren’t mini-VM, it’s just easier to picture them as such sometimes***

- They are just processes and have limits to what they can access running on the host.

- They do not contain low-level Operating System files like kernels or kernel modules, they just use the ones in the host machine.

- (In Linux) you can `ps aux` and see that is listed along with all the other processes (although with different permissions etc)

Different containers need to listen on different ports of the host to run simultaneously




## 101 Commands

To start a new container from an image just:


```docker container run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG…]```

Every time you run a new container you get a new unique ID.

Check containers running: 
    ```docker container ls```

Check all containers (stopped included):
    ```docker container ls -a```

Start an existing but stopped container:

```docker container start "container_id"```


1. First checks image locally in image cache
2. Then checks remote image repository (default is Docker Hub)
3. Downloads it and stores in image cache
4. Start new container
5. Gives virtual IP address in a private network inside the docker engine
6. Open port 80 on host and forward it to a port 80 in container
7. Start container using the command in the Dockerfile

E.g `docker container run `

`--publish`  or `-p 8080:80` (host port:container port)

`--name webhost` (give specific name)

`--detach` or `-d` (run process in the background)

`nginx:1.11` (image with specific version)

You can even install a whole Linux distro!

```docker container run -it --name ubuntu ubuntu```

All containers have their unique name (if not giving explicitly is randomly generated e.g blissful_shannon)

See the logs for specific container
```docker container logs “name”```

See the processes running within the container
```docker top “name”``` or ```docker ps```

Inspect configuration details of a container
```docker container inspect “name”```

Stop container
```docker container stop “name”```

Delete container
    ```docker container logs “first 3 digits of its ID (e.g f52)“```

Inside a container

In order to work inside a container you can either ssh into it or just directly access it through a terminal (pseudo-TTY) with the arguments:
`-i` or `--interactive` (keep session open to receive inputs from terminal)
and
`-t` or `--tty` (allocates a pseudo-TTY terminal that simulates a real one) when using run
or 
`-a` when using start

```docker container run -it nginx bash```
or
```docker container start -ai nginx bash```

When you want to enter a running container to use the terminal:  

```docker container exec -it nginx bash```

`run` is for starting up new containers
`exec` is for adding more commands to running containers

***However***: you can only run commands (like bash) inside a container that are already included in their image! For example, alpine (minimal security oriented linux distro) does not include bash by default so if you were to try to run the above it wouldn't be able to
