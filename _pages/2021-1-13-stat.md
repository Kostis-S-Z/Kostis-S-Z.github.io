# Statistical tests for comparing Machine Learning models

When making comparisons and conclusions regarding ML / DL models it is important to try to get as much evidence as possible and then perform statistical tests. Below is a cheatsheet I made while trying to find the appropriate test I needed to do depending on the case.

- Classification and I have access to the test predictions ---> **Make a contingency table**
My label type is:
  - Binary
    *Number of classifiers to compare:*
      - Two -> McNemar's test
      - Three or more -> Cochran's Q test
  - Multi-class ---> **Stuart - Maxwell test**


- Models based on mean performance values (e.g mean test accuracy, average rewards, success rate etc)
Is your sample size large enough? Do you have insights about the data and your samples?
  - **Parametric methods**: _I can assume normal distribution of samples_
    *Number of models to compare:*
      - Two
        - Student's t-test (assuming equal variance) (there is also a version for _paired_ samples)
        - Welch's t-test (*not* assuming equal variance)
      - Three or more
        - ANOVA (F-test) or ANOVA for *paired* samples

  - **Non-Parametric**: _I cannot assume normal distribution of samples_
    *Number of models to compare:*
      - Two
        - Mann-Whitney U test
        - Wilcoxon for *paired* samples
      - Three or more
        - Kruskal-Wallis
        - Friedman for *paired* samples
