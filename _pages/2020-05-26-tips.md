_This lists will keep being updated by suggestions of friends & colleagues, or whenever I feel enlightened.

### Tips

1. _Before you run your code, have clear expectations of what this code will do._
 
 This will help you build a solid understanding of what you are building, why stuff works and, most importantly, why stuff _don't_ work. Additionally, splitting the code into small but clear-cut functions / classes can help you both maintain faster and debug easier by narrowing down the issue to specific modules. 
 
2. Make **short term** goals, such as a weekly checklist, and don't delete it at the end of the week! Saving in notes the progress you went through during the previous weeks can help your moral and motivate you when you are questioning the value of your work.

3. Iterating too slowly. You will. There is no question about it. It might be for a week, it might be for a month. At some point, you might reach a plateau because of x and y, that's fine. However, if you plan for this, you can leverage this "not-so-productive" time, to make progress on other tasks, like writing your report, catching up on related work, refactor or optimize old code, cleanup the repo, make a nice readme etc.

4. Keep notes of *every* (yes, *every*) run you make, why you made it, what were the expected results and what were your actual results. After working in a project for a long time and something starts going wrong after months of work, you can lose your sanity (and time) by questioning every part of the code from the start. If you have a thorough straighforward notebook of experiments / tests you have done in the past, it can help your future self understand why stuff are they way they are.


### Tools I could not image doing my thesis without 
_at least +25% productivity gain_

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) (Online LaTeX Editor)

  - but you could also use: [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) etc
- [Weights&Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) (Model tracking)
  - but you could also use: [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/), [neptune.ai](https://neptune.ai/), [guild.ai](https://guild.ai/), [comet.ml](https://www.comet.ml)
