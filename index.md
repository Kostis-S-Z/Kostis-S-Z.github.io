### Autoencoders:

"When the decoder is linear and L is the mean squared error an undercomplete autoencoder learns to span the same subspace as PC.

In this case, an autoencoder trained to perform the copying task has learned the principal subspace of the training data as a side effect.

Autoencoders with nonlinear encoder functions f and nonlinear decoder functions g can thus learn a more powerful nonlinear generalization of PCA
